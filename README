This is Wendell's code for what will hopefully someday be a curses frontend for ipython.

At the moment, it is more of a prototype - it is not linked into ipython.

Dependencies:
pygments

To run:
python prototype.py

Type in python code, hit CTRL-G to send, and it is displayed in color above.
Type <CTRL-G> with no text to quit.

To force 256 colors (terminals often have more than they advertise):
python interpreterwidget.py -c

Use a different pygments style:
python interpreterwidget.py -s native
python interpreterwidget.py -s perldoc

It is very basic, but it demonstrates input, output, and code-coloring.
